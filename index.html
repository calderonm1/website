              <h1>Hi, welcome to my website!</h1>
              <p>My name is Mateo Calderon and I'm a Junior Computer-Science major at the College of New Jersey. Thanks for taking the time to visit my website, which was coded entirely from scratch using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Please take some time to browse some projects I've completed located in the "Portfolio" section </p>
              <p>More about me, some of my hobbies include playing rugby (which I am currently the President of the TCNJ Men's Rugby Club), chess, fishing, and coding (which you can see more of on this website!)</p>
              <p>If you have any questions or would simply like to reach out to me, you can contact me via <a href ="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mateo-calderon-a55552221/" style = "color: lightseagreen">LinkedIn</a> or my email: mecalderon@icloud.com.</p>
